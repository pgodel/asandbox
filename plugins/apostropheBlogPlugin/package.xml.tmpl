      <notes>Version 1.5.1 is an important stability and bug-fixing release. Strongly recommended for those using the tarball releases. MUCH BETTER IDEA: set up the Apostrophe plugins as svn:externals pointing to the 1.5 stable branch so you get important fixes with every svn update (but not radical new buggy features).

Here's what we fixed in 1.5.1:

  * Categories are correctly mirrored to the virtual page, fixes search problems
  * Tag import is now supported
  * Some adjustments to disqus, added ability to enable developer mode in app.yml, added the comment count to the blog meta partial
  * Import task cleanup
  * i18n fixes
  * No more defaults for blog import, you have to specify --events=filename.xml and/or --posts=filename.xml. This way you are not surprised by a double-import from the default location
  * disqus comment code was showing up even when disqus was disabled (fixed)
  * aBlog.js needs to be in view.yml, period, due to blog slots (sandbox fix, removed nonfunctioning code to load it)
  * Fixed missing tag widget label
  * Blog header appears properly when logged out
  * Many fixes to apostrophe:migrate to ensure category information is brought over from the 1.4 plugin, alpha versions of the 1.5 plugin
  * Behave gracefully when blog posts no longer have an author (author deleted)
  * UI improvements and fixes
  * getRichTextForAreas method, convenient for lightweight views where you don't need independent slots
  * Admins were losing their ownership upon saving of the blog post form because the list of allowed authors did not contain them (fixed)
  * Author filters are now alphabetically sorted 
  * You can now filter by "No Author" 
  * Category filters are now alphabetically sorted 
  * You can now locate uncategorized posts by selecting "Uncategorized" from the Categories filter dropdown
  * Author and category filters can be combined with other filters properly
  * Google Calendar URLs were often too long; imposed a character limit rather than a word limit to ensure this does not happen
