These fixtures are borrowed from the sandbox project, where they are most
regularly maintained and updated. The blog and events engine pages have been
removed since they would be difficult to remove through the UI if you are
not using the blog plugin. Some other references to the blog remain in terms of
permissions but this will be useful to you if you add it.
