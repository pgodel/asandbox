   *
   * THIS METHOD WILL NOT WORK RELIABLY UNLESS THE ROUTING CACHE IS TURNED **OFF**.
   *
   * The routing cache defaults to off in new Symfony 1.3 and 1.4 projects because
   * it has found to hurt performance in most cases, sometimes quite severely. We do 
   * not currently enable it on any of our projects.
   * 
   * The routing cache does not take the desired engine page into account, so it will
   * return URLs targeting the wrong page. If you must use the routing cache,
   * design your projects to avoid the use of multiple engine pages for the
   * same engine module.
   *
   * This method sets a specific target engine page for any url_for, link_to, etc. 
   * calls invoking an engine route. If you have only one instance of a given engine 
   * in your site, you don't need to call this method. A link generated within that 
   * engine page will target the same engine page, and a link generated from anywhere 
   * else will target the first engine page for that engine module name found in 
   * the database. If you have more than one engine page for the same engine module 
   * name, and you care which one the link points to, call this method to specify 
   * that page. 
   *
   * A stack of target engine slugs is maintained for each engine module name.
   * This allows you to push a new engine page at the top of a partial or component
   * that potentially targets a different engine page than the template that
   * invoked it, and then pop that engine page at the end to ensure that any links
   * generated later in the calling template still target the original engine page.
   *
   * You can pass a page object or, for convenience, a page slug. The latter is useful
   * when targeting an engine page that is guaranteed to exist, such as /admin/media
   *
   * @param  aPage $page|string $page The target engine page for engine routes, or a page slug
