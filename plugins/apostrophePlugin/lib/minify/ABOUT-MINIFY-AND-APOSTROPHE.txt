tom@punkave.com: I modified this to not try to resolve symbolic links aggressively
as that makes little sense when the paths you have passed in are web paths - the
webserver does not resolve symlinks before resolving relative paths, so it doesn't
make sense to realpath() everything.

We do not use Minify as a content server, we use it only as a very smart minifier.
