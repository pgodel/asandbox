This task downloads the latest content samples, including the database and the media files, from 
content.apostrophenow.com. That content is much more complete and interesting than the
simple fixtures files provided with apostrophePlugin. This is the same content that is regularly
used to reset content.apostrophenow.com.

To use this task you must be using MySQL. The command line 'mysql' utility must be in the path.
You must have the command line 'unzip' utility. And PHP must be compiled with support for http
in file commands like 'copy' (which is almost always the case).

If you are missing any of these requirements, it's no big deal: you can still use the fixtures
(with the ./symfony doctrine:data-load task). They just aren't as much fun. But you're going to
build your own site anyway, right?

You should only do this on a brand-new site. On an existing site it will overwrite all of your content.
